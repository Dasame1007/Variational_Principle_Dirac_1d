This repository contains the Python code used to produce the numerical results presented in the article _"On the existence of eigenvalues of a one-dimensional Dirac operator"_ [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12697) [[Journal]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X25002665) written by Daniel SÃ¡nchez-Mendoza and Monika Winklmeier.

The Jupyter notebook [Variational_Principle_Dirac_1d.ipynb](src/Variational_Principle_Dirac_1d.ipynb) numerically implements the variational principle and applies it to an example taken form [[DKTZ23]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04033). The output is saved into the file [data.csv](src/data.csv) which is then loaded into the Wolfram Mathematica notebook [Plots.nb](src/Plots.nb) where it is plotted alongside some analytical examples.
